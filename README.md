**Project Brief**

This is a single page app that allows a user to register and log a report of an alien encounter. It is built with the Angular framework. The main objective of this project is to work with an API using the GET and POST requests. The GET requests are used to populate dropdown lists and display a list of all logged reports. The POST request is used to pass new reports to the API.

**Tools and Methods Used**

- AngularJS
- HTML/CSS
- Flexbox
- Fluid design
- Accessing an API with GET and POST requests
- Git and GitHub

**Personal Summary**

I really enjoyed learning the Angular framework and applying the concepts for this project. I can appreciate how the 2 way data binding is a powerful tool for working with user interactions.
